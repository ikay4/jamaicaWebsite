        </div>
        <p>

            to fight for both their rights and freedoms for now years.

            motivation to keep going strong, and this part of the Website
            will go over the important events of Jamaican History so that
            you can connect with the Jamaicans in a deeper way by understanding
            what the had to go through to get where they are today.

            <h1> The Beginning </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            The first ever people to live in Jamaica was the Tanino Indians,
            who were around since 600 AD. They were stone-age people, who migerated
            to Jamaica from present South America. They lived in Jamaica peacefully,
            until the Spanish found their land, wiping the Tanino Indians due to the
            exploitation of the Spanish, along with being unable to resist European
            diseases and most of them starving to death. Some of the Tanino even killed
            themselves, just so they couldn't become a slave for the Spanish. In the end,
            all the Tanino Indians were either dead or had become slaves, ending with
            all the Tanino Indians being killed off. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This now brings us to when the Spanish settled Jamaica after defeating
            the Tanino Indians. The infamous Christopher Columbus landed in Jamaica
            in 1494, and after defeating the Tanino Indians, the colonized the
            land for themselves. Soon after they colonized the land, they built 
            the first ever city in Jamacia, called <i>Sevilla Nueva.</i>
            At first, Sevilla Nueva was located in <i>Saint Ann's Ba</i>, but
            was later moved to the capital of Jamaica, called <i>Spanish Town.</i>
            Now, of course, Jamaica was never really the busy due to the fact
            that no gold was found on the island, and during that time, Jamaica
            mainly served as a food supply for ships that were sailing between
            the Americas and Eruope.

        <div class="pTitle">
            <h1>The British Period</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            In 1655, the British then arrived in Jamaica and captured it from the Spanish,
            taking over Jamaica for more than 300 years. Britain capture Jamaica from the Spanish
            due to it being a strategic location, in the centre of the Caribbean, to challenge
            the Spanish and interruping their trade. Many of the settlers was just land-owners,
            but others were pirates, who attacked the Spanish Ships which carried gold
            and silver, the Priates HQ at Port Royal became rich with all the stolen goods.
            <br>
            <br>
            Later on, Port Royal would become destoryed with earthquakes and hurricanes, but 
            by then the English and Spanish already signed a peace treaty, with pirates
            not being needed anymore. Jamaica just become a trading port with the exportation
            of sugar, cocoa, and more. Because of the destoryed Royal Port, it led to the rise
            of the nearby fishing village, Kingston , becoming the capital of Jamaica in 1872.
        </p>

        <div class="pTitle">
            <h1>Resistance to Slavery</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Started by the Spanish and intensivied under British ruling, slavery in 
            Jamaica was a problem for a long time. As production of goods like sugar
            increased, the demand for slaves went up as well. Even though back in the
            18th century, Jamaica was the most valueable colonies, the conditions
            slaves had to go through was the hellish, many familes being sperated,
            tourtured, and killed off.
            <br>
            <br>
            Later on though, the slave trade was abolished in the yeat 1807. But
            by then, ~2,000,000 slaves were traded to Jamaica, many of those slaves
            dieing on the ships. But, slavery was gone for good, just the trade. It took
            citizens another 31 years to finally get rid of slavery for good.
            In total, it took citizens around 250 years of rebellion to get rid
            of slavery forever.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the end of slavery brought the collapse of plantation systems as the 
            former slaves refused to work for their masters anymore. This, along with other
            factors, caused a crisis in 1865, calling for a change in social and economic
            patterns quickly. This caused the Morant Bay Rebellion, which ended up with the
            leaders of Jamacia being hung. From now on, it was up to the British to handle
            Jamaica, leading to the British Governor introducing a House of Assembly, which 
            was put into place by the British Parliament in 1866.

        <div class="pTitle">
            <h1>Independence</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now, going forward many years, the dissatisfaction with the crown colony 
            system, which was made worse by the suffering because of worldwide
            econmic depression, caused widespread rioting in Jamaica. These riots
            resulted in the first lasting labour unions, as well as political parties
            which were linked to the labour unions. It was apparent that the Jamaicans
            had a growing demand for self-determination.
            <br>
            <br>
            Political Agaitations and Trade union leaders led to the granting of a new
            constitution, introduced in 1944, which called for a 2 party H.o.R, as well
            as Ministers and adult suffrage. The constitution was also advanced multiple 
            times in 1953 and 1957, with Jamaica obtaining full internal self-government
            in 1959. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Jamaica then became of a founding memeber of teh Deferation of the West Indies,
            seceding from it in 1961 after some troubles. Then, finally, after over 300 
            years of many Jamaicans fighting, rioting, and being killed, Jamaica became 
            an Independence nation in 1962, having full dominion status with the commonwealth!
