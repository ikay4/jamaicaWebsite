        </div>
        <p>
            Want to relax and play in Jamaica's most beautiful beach? With breathtaking
            stretches of white sand and the clear, aqua sea, the Seven Mile Beach, also
            known as the Negril Beach, is right for you!
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, even though the nickname is "Seven Mile Beach", it is really closer
            to 4 miles, extending from Bloody Bay to Long Bay. It is one of the
            best beaches Jamaica has to offer, and it great for couples who want
            to play water sports and familys who want to relax! There are many
            activities you can do here, like play water sports or go snorkeling!
            Now, you will need to hawkers, which are people wanting to sell goods,
            but just a polite "No, thank you!" will work out fine! Also, resorts
            are all over this beach, so visiting this beach could also give you some
            thoughts about where you want to stay the next time you visit Jamaica!
