            <h1> Getting to Jamaica </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Getting to Jamaica is pretty simple, just like any other vaction. 
            On average, fares to fly to Jamaica were around $248-$280. But,
            depending on what month, prices could be either very expensive or
            very cheap. For example, the most expensive month tends to be either January,
            November, and December, most likely because of the cold. The cheapest month tends
            to be February. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, of course, all the prices can change depending on multiple factors, like 
            where you are reletive to Jamaica, taxi services, which airline you are flying, and more. If you want to learn
            more about getting to Jamaica from where you are, I would go to the website 
            <a href="https://www.kayak.com/">"kayak.com"</a>, which tells you everything
            that you would need to know about getting to Jamaica!

            <h1> General Info </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Jamacia is a mountainious island, located in the Caribbean Sea.
            It is part of the chain of Caribbean islands called the Greater Antilles,
            and Cube, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico are all part of this chain, along
            with Jamaica as well. If you ever have been on a Cruise, you most likely 
            have been in Jamaica at least once.
            <br>
            <br>
            As of right now, 5/10/23, the population in 2023 is 2,825,544. Compared to last year,
            the growth rate is -0.06, the population going down 1,833 citizens. Here is a table 
            listing out the population from 2015 to 2023.
            <br>
            <br>
            As we can see from this table, the population was on a fairly steady rise,
            but in 2022, the population started dropping. Thankfully, the decay rate is small,
            but it does concern people what the future will hold as Jamaica has not ever been
            in a decline of population since 1950. The U.N. even predicts that by 2100, 
            Jamaica will only have 897,000 citizens.

            <h1>Things to know before leaving</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Firstly, you'll need to understand that different parts of Jamaica are for
            different travelers. For example, if you like relaxing at beaches and having
            fun doing water sports, Negril and the north coast of Jamaica would work best for
            you! What to surround yourself with amazing dining scenes, close to the buzzy
            nightlife and the awesome natural attractions? Than Montego Bay and Ocho Rios would
            be lovely! So, before leaving, remember what you want to do in Jamaica, and then
            plan for which part of the island you want to stay at!
            <br>
            <br>
            Secondly, the citizens! If you have ever been to outside countries, you most likely 
            have tried to talk to the locals, but then it fell apart right after. But, in Jamaica,
            feel free to talk to the locals! Of course, some Jamaicans will try to start a 
            conservation so that you can buy what they are selling, but you don't need to worry, 
            as that is rare! Most Jamaicans really just want to know about you and your life,
            and they find just ingoring them really rude. You'll find yourself greeting everyone!
            And, remember, always treat the elders with extra resepct. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, just to keep you safe, you should never drink any tap
            water, no matter what part of the island you are located at. Just 
            like most countries you travel to, you aren't used to the water
            there, so your stomach won't be able to handle the bactieria in
            the water and you will, sadly, have an unenjoyable vaction to Jamaica.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Now, of course, there are a lot of more things that you should check
            out before leaving. The video below this will explain everything you 
            should need to know before leaving, so remember to watch this and have fun!
